### Problem 2

*Chapter 5, Exercise 6 (Sec. 5.4, p. 199)*

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F}
library(ISLR); library(boot)
set.seed(1)
attach(Default)
```

#### Part A

```{r}
fit = glm(default ~ income + balance, family = 'binomial')
summary(fit)$coef
```

#### Part B

```{r}
boot.fn = function(d, i)
  return( coef(lm(default ~ income + balance, data = d, subset = i)) )
```

#### Part C

```{r, warning=F}
boot.fn(Default, 1:nrow(Default))
boot(Default, boot.fn, 1000)
```

#### Part D

The estimated standard errors obtained using the `glm()` function and the bootstrap function were within a fairly small range of each other. `glm()` resulted in standard errors of `[4.3e-1, 4.9e-6, 2.3e-4]`, while bootstrap resulted in `[6.5e-3, 1.3e-7, 6.6e-6]`, both of which equate to very small errors. As a result, we can see that the two methods are interchangeable in this situation.
